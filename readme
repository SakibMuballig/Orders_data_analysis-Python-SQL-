🚀 Order Data Analysis: Unlocking Business Insights with Python & SQL 🛒📊

I recently worked on an Order Data Analysis project where I leveraged Python and SQL to analyze retail order data and extract valuable business insights. This project involved:

🔹 Data Preprocessing with Python (Pandas & SQLAlchemy)
✔️ Cleaning and transforming raw data
✔️ Handling missing values and renaming columns for consistency
✔️ Calculating key metrics like profit, discount, and sales price
✔️ Storing and querying data efficiently in Microsoft SQL Server

🔹 SQL Analysis for Business Insights
📌 Identified the top 10 revenue-generating products
📌 Analyzed the best-selling products per region
📌 Compared month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs 2023)
📌 Determined the highest sales month per category
📌 Discovered the fastest-growing subcategory by profit
