🚀 Order Data Analysis: Unlocking Business Insights with Python, SQL & Kaggle API 🛒📊

I recently worked on an Order Data Analysis project where I leveraged Python, SQL, and the Kaggle API to analyze retail order data and extract valuable business insights.

🔹 Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

 ✔️ Used Kaggle API to fetch retail order data
 ✔️ Extracted and cleaned raw data using Pandas
 ✔️ Handled missing values and standardized column names
 ✔️ Calculated key business metrics (profit, discount, and sales price)
 ✔️ Stored and queried data in Microsoft SQL Server (MSSMS)

🔹 SQL Analysis for Business Insights
 📌 Identified the top 10 revenue-generating products
 📌 Analyzed the best-selling products per region
 📌 Compared month-over-month sales growth (2022 vs 2023)
 📌 Determined the highest sales month per category
 📌 Discovered the fastest-growing subcategory by profit
